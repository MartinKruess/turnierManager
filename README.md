# turnierManager

Thats an Electron Project to create a desktop Application for managing gaming competitions.
This programm is helping you managing things like..
- building the competition tree
- getting Player- and Team-Data for the analytics
- calculation the MVP´s in different situations

It is working for single users and communitys. Every competition is starting by 8 Teams and can max handle 32 Teams with a maximum of 6 Players.
At this point of development the communitys havn´t a Login function, so it isn´t possible to share the data of done competitions with other users from the community. (no Database, to load data from an other workspace)

## Supported games until now:
